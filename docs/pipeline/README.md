# ESP as a Pipeline

## Definitions

- data process
- data product

## Introduction

We often talk about two types of pipelines: operational and private. They only difference between them is the operational is notionally public while the private is notionally private. Other than these notional access differences, they are the ame. In reality, everyone has the same access to private pipelines as they do operational ones.

## Description

Because the actual pipeline changes as we commit and update code, the description here is a highlight of the tasks and algorithms from moment in time. To know its current form, you would have to start a pipeline and [view it live](interact).
